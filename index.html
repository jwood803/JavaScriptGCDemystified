							<h2>Why does this matter with JavaScript?</h2>
							<img class="fragment" src="img/screenshots/hesdead.png">

							<aside class="notes">
								Mention to how much JavaScript is being much more widely used and that functionality is getting put more on the client than on the server.
								Also make a special note about SPAs as well and say that with these, page refreshes are becoming much less frequent so items stay in memory much longer. Also,
								users can leave up pages going for days which leaves objects in memory.

					<section id="javascriptMemory">
						<h2>How does memory work in JavaScript?</h2>

							After a value is sufficiently old (how many young gen collections it survives - usually the standard

						<ul>
							<li>jsHeapSizeLimit - Memory the JavaScript heap is limited to</li>
							<li>usedJSHeapSize - Memory currently being used</li>
							<li>totalJSHeapSize - Memory that has been allocated on the JavaScript heap (includes free space)</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
						  heapSizeLimit - The total amount that JS has access to.
							usedHeapSize - Memory that currently is in use by live objects.
							totalHeapSize - Memory that has been allocated so far, inclusing free space.

							This can be used for logging and even used for graphing. Information can be used to predict the "he's dead, Jim".

							Mention the caveat Chrome has that, even though each tab is a separate process, it can spawn a finite number of processes.
							So if there are a lot of tabs open, multiple tabs can share a process. If that's the case, the memory of the other tabs will
							be represented by the API call.

					<section id="heapTimeline">
						<img src="img/screenshots/heapTimeline.jpg">

						<aside class="notes">
							Blue bars indicate objects that are still live at the end of the timeline, gray bars indicate objects that were allocated during
							the timeline, but have since been garbage collected.

							In the retaining tree, you'll notice two colors - yellow and red. Red is when the object doesn't have direct references from
							JavaScript to them, but are alive. Yellow nodes do have direct references from JavaScript. There should be a chain of properties
							leading from the DOM window to the element (i.e. window.foo.bar[2]).

						<h2><a href="js/Demo/index.html">Demo</a> time!</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							Small messaging app that caches messages for better performance for the users. Only 5 messages should be cached at a time.

							MessageAuxData = message header. There would be a count of 6 (should be 5).
							Clicking a blue bar displays a diff of what's still live at that time. A grey bar should show nothing.

							JavaScript can be dangerous if it's abused too much! Too much memory = very frequent GCs = unhappy users

					<section id="takeAways">
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">How much memory is the page using?</li>
							<li class="fragment">Is the page GCing too frequently?</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							1. Using more memory can be detrimental to the page's performance since it will cause more frequent GCs which will cause the page
							a lot of pauses to the page to perform the collections.

							2. This can be found out by using the timeline tool. A lot of GCs = allocating a lot of objects.

							The more memory, the longer the pause needed to do the collection. Leads to poor user interaction and users will be frustrated.
